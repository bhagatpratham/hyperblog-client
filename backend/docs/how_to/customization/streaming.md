# Streaming

LlamaIndex supports streaming the response as it's being generated.
This allows you to start printing or processing the beginning of the response before the full response is finished.
This can drastically reduce the perceived latency of queries.

### Setup
To enable streaming, you need to configure two things:
1. Use an LLM that supports streaming, and set `streaming=True`.
```python
llm_predictor = LLMPredictor(
    llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", streaming=True)
)
service_context = ServiceContext.from_defaults(
    llm_predictor=llm_predictor
)
```
Right now, streaming is supported by OpenAI and HuggingFace LLMs.

2. Configure query engine to use streaming  

If you are using the high-level API, set `streaming=True` when building a query engine.
```python
query_engine = index.as_query_engine(
    streaming=True,
    similarity_top_k=1
)
```

If you are using the low-level API to compose the query engine,
pass `streaming=True` when constructing the `ResponseSynthesizer`:
```python
synth = ResponseSynthesizer.from_args(streaming=True, ...)
query_engine = RetrieverQueryEngine(response_synthesizer=synth, ...)
```

### Streaming Response
After properly configuring both the LLM and the query engine,
calling `query` now returns a `StreamingResponse` object.

```python
streaming_response = query_engine.query(
    "What did the author do growing up?", 
)
```

The response is returned immediately when the LLM call *starts*, without having to wait for the full completion.

> Note: In the case where the query engine makes multiple LLM calls, only the last LLM call will be streamed and the response is returned when the last LLM call starts.

You can obtain a `Generator` from the streaming response and iterate over the tokens as they arrive:
```python
for text in streaming_response.response_gen:
    # do something with text as they arrive.
```

Alternatively, if you just want to print the text as they arrive:
```
streaming_response.print_response_stream() 
```
