    "\n",
    "This demo notebook shows how you can use [Vellum](https://www.vellum.ai/) to manage the prompts you use within LlamaIndex. By registering LlamaIndex prompts with Vellum via the `VellumPredictor` class, you're able to use Vellum to:\n",
    "1. View and manage all your prompts in a UI\n",
    "2. Compare and constrast prompt templates, and even different LLM providers/models side-by-side\n",
    "3. Update your prompt, or the provider/model backing it, without updating or re-deploying code\n",
    "4. Set up unit tests to test your prompt and quantitatively evaluate the quality of its outputs\n",
    "5. Observe and monitor all traffic to it, including the inputs sent to the model, and the outputs sent back\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign up for a free Vellum account at [app.vellum.ai/signup](https://app.vellum.ai/signup)\n",
    "2. Go to [app.vellum.ai/api-keys](https://app.vellum.ai/api-keys) and generate a Vellum API key. Note it down somewhere."

    "\n",
    "We mentioned above that the LlamaIndex <> Vellum integration with auto-register LlamaIndex prompts in Vellum – one per `PromptType`. However, you may want to:\n",
    "1. Reference an already existing Deployment that you manually created in Vellum; and/or\n",
    "2. Auto-register more than one Sandbox/Deployment per `PromptType`. Perhaps you want to be able to differentiate monitoring data across two separate product use-cases that use the same `PromptType`, or maybe you want to use different model/prompt template for the same `PromptType`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Referencing Existing Deployments\n",
    "Vellum looks for the optionally provided `Prompt.metadata[\"vellum_deployment_id\"]` and/or `Prompt.metadata[\"vellum_deployment_name\"]`. Both are uniquely identifying.\n",
    "\n",
    "If either are provided upon instantiating the Prompt, or by updating its metadata after the fact, Vellum will detect the existing Deployment and use it rather than creating a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auto-Registering Multiple Prompts Per Type\n",
    "Simlilar to above, you can use `Prompt.metadata[\"vellum_deployment_name\"]` to specify the name of the Deployment you'd like to use. If none exists by that name, the prompt will be auto-registered and a new Deployment will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of `vellum_deployment_name` should be a kebab-case string (e.g. `\"my-deployment\"` not `\"MY_DEPLOYMENT\"`).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may optionally also provide `vellum_deployment_label` to give it a human-friendly name. If none is provided, a default will be generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Else?\n",
    "So far we've seen how we can use the LlamaIndex <> Vellum integration to make it easy to experiment with prompts and monitor their inputs/outputs. However, Vellum offers a full suite of tools to help bring AI-powered apps to production, including tools for quantitatively testing prompts, performing semantic search, and more.
