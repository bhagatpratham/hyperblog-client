He wrote a book on Lisp and did freelance Lisp hacking work to support himself. He also became the de facto studio assistant for Idelle Weber, an early photorealist painter. He eventually had the idea to start a company to put art galleries online, but the idea was unsuccessful. He then had the idea to write software to build online stores, which became the basis for his successful company, Viaweb. After Viaweb was acquired by Yahoo!, the author returned to painting and started writing essays online. He wrote a book of essays, Hackers & Painters, and worked on spam filters. He also bought a building in Cambridge to use as an office. He then had the idea to start Y Combinator, an investment firm that would make a larger number of smaller investments and help founders remain as CEO. He and his partner Jessica Livingston ran Y Combinator and funded a batch of startups twice a year. He also continued to write essays, cook for groups of friends, and explore the concept of invented vs discovered in software. He created the Summer Founders Program, which invited under</b>"
